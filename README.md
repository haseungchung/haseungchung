# Hello, thank you for stopping by my page!

## My name is Ha Seung, and I am an AI engineer currently open to job opportunities.
Although being an AI engineer is my technical profession and main passion, I would generally describe myself as an obsessive **inventor/innovator** looking to solve problems both big and small. But don't just take my word for it, see it for yourself!
